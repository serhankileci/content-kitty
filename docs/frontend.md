# **Frontend**

- A customizable admin panel where you can manage your table data, handle CRUD operations, manage plugins, add custom pages or customize default pages via importing default admin panel components or completely new. You can also completely disable the frontend and use Content Kitty as-is with your own separate frontend.
  - Pages will be generated for your tables with searching/ordering/filtering/pagination, etc.
  - Create custom pages
  - The default panel blocks come with i18n, and your Content Kitty tables/fields inherit your i18n settings for them.
